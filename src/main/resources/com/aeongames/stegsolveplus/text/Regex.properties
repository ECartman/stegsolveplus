#option A: 
#Match drive or UNC start or the Extended path should use the pprefix "\\\\?\\" -->    (?:"?(?:\\\\\\\\\\?\\\\)?(?:[a-zA-Z]:[\\\\/]|[\\\\]{2})
#matches any path except the unallowed characters (review the MS documentation)   (?:[^\\\\/"<>:\\\\|?\\\\*]+[\\\\/])*)
#matches the file name    [^\\\\/"<>:\\\\|?\\\\* ]+(?:"|(?!\\s))?
#     *   lets allow matching UNC (Start) path for example: "\\\\networkshare\\xxxxxx"
#     *   lets allow matching C:\\ or C:/ (either "\\/")
#     *   lets match whatever path that does not contain the Reserved characters (according to MS documentations)
#     *   support Extended path ("\\?\")
#NOTE: on windows (modern) path limit is 0x7FFF  (extended-length) or otherwise 260 (MAX_PATH) characters
#according to MS doco. a Extended path should use the pprefix "\\\\?\\"
